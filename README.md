  Strapi Source Plugin
</h1>

Source plugin for pulling documents into Gatsby-v4 from the Strapi-v4 graphql API.

## ðŸš€ Installing the plugin

> This version of gatsby-source-strapi is only compatible with Strapi v4 and uses the graphql api of Strapi.


```shell
# Using Yarn
yarn add gatsby-source-strapi@relate-app/gatsby-source-strapi

# Or using NPM
npm install --save gatsby-source-strapi@relate-app/gatsby-source-strapi
```

## ðŸ”¥ Setting up the plugin

You can enable and configure this plugin in your gatsby-config.js file.

### Basic usage

```js
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-source-strapi',
    options: {
      apiURL: 'http://localhost:1337',
      collectionTypes: ['Article', 'User'],
      singleTypes: ['Home Page', 'Contact'],
      // Extract images from markdown fields.
      markdownImages: {
        typesToParse: {
          Article: ['body'],
          ComponentBlockBody: ['text'],
        },
      },
      // Only include specific locale.
      locale: 'en', // default to all
      // Include drafts in build.
      preview: true, // defaults to false
    },
  },
];
```

### Internationalization support

Strapi now supports internationalization. But by default, this plugin will only fetch data in the default locale of your Strapi app. If your content types are available in different locales, you can also pass an entity definition object to specify the locale you want to fetch for a content type. Use the all value to get all available locales on a collection type.

### Relationship support

Relationships to other collections both in collection fields and components are automatically connected to each other and included as a field if the node being linked to is included in the collectionTypes in your gatsby-config.

### Draft content

Strapi now supports Draft and publish, which allows you to save your content as a draft and publish it later. By default, this plugin will only fetch the published content.

But you may want to fetch unpublished content in Gatsby as well. To do so, find a content type that has draft & publish enabled, and add an entity definition object to your config. Then, set preview to true in gatsby-config.

### Authenticated requests

Strapi's Roles & Permissions plugin allows you to protect your API actions. If you need to access a route that is only available to a logged in user, you can provide your credentials so that this plugin can access to the protected data.

## Querying data

You can query Document nodes created from your Strapi API like the following:

```graphql
{
  allStrapiArticle {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        content
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can query Document nodes in a chosen language:

```graphql
{
  allStrapiArticle(filter: { locale: { eq: "en" } }) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        content
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To query images you can do the following:

```graphql
{
  allStrapiArticle {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        singleImage {
          file {
            publicURL
          }
        }
        multipleImages {
          file {
            publicURL
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To query markdown images for a markdown field named "text" you can do the following:

> To replace in markdown use the base returned from the file and create a custom renderer to match the url on the image with the base.

```graphql
{
  allStrapiArticle {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        text
        text_images {
          base
          publicURL
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
